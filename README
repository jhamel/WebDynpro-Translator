This application enables you to exchange the content of the resource files of a SAP Web Dynpro project with a
translation office, get the translated file back and import it into the resource files of the Web Dynpro project.

How it works:
The program
- traverses all directories of one or more Web Dynpro projects (all projects it finds beneath the baseDirWebDynpro)
- extracts all phrases from all xlf-files
- removes all duplicate entries and
- save the results into an csv file
In the csv file there is one column for each language (<xxx>_<lang>.xlf) that was found. In the first column you find
the value of the original Web Dynpro project language (<xxx>.xlf)
You then send the csv file to a translation office. It adds the translations for all not yet translated phrases and
sends the file back to you.
You then use the program to
- import the altered csv file and
- update all xlf files in the Web Dynpro project (if the xlf files for the language havenÂ´t been created yet the program
creates them.)

Usage:
You can use the program by executing the Main class with a java runtime. For your convenience there are a fex shell
script in the root folder of the project that you can use as a template.
